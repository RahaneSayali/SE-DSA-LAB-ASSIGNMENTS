GROUP-A-1.Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers.

GROUP-A-4.To create ADT that implement the "set" concept.
a. Add (newElement) -Place a value into the set
b. Remove (element) Remove the value
c. Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection
d. Size () Return number of values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop
over collection
e. Intersection of two sets
f. Union of two sets
g. Difference between two sets
h.Subset

GROUP-B-5. A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of
subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements
of your method.

GROUP-B-6. Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every
node
v. Search a value

GROUP-B-7. Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and
traverse it using postordertraversal(non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. 

GROUP-C-13. Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency
list to perform BFS.

GROUP-C-14. There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take
to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

GROUP-D-18. Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each
key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
probability for each key?

GROUP-D-19. A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords,
deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data
sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may
require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for
finding a keyword.

GROUP-F-23. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name,
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display
information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential
file to main the data.

GROUP-F-25. Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct
access file
